There’s an existing method we can use to set up a mobile Launchpad and Mission Control Room (MCR).
We’ll use AirFiber technology, which gives us high-speed, long-range wireless communication — no physical cables needed.
But since we have a forest blocking line of sight, direct AirFiber won’t work over 7 km.
To solve this, we'll deploy a 30-meter movable relay tower that creates a clear wireless path between the MCR and Launchpad.
The tower is telescopic and trailer-mounted, so it can be moved and set up wherever needed.
This approach gives us a completely mobile, flexible, and safe communication network.
It’s perfect for launch operations at changing locations, field trials, or remote mission testing.
We can adopt this method to make our operations more efficient and field-ready.
